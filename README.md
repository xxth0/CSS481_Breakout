Modified Breakout Version 1.0

This project is a part of CSS481: Special Topics in Computer Engineering Fundamentals I (Topic: Game Development).

Even though the assignment is already concluded, I would still update the game as a side hobby.

To run the game please install Pygame first with `pip install pygame` Then start the game with `python main.py`


Version 1.1 will have these features:
1. Turn on/off logs
2. Improved Brick tier sprites
3. More Power-ups
4. ...
